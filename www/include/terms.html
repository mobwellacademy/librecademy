<p>This program consists of an online group of people passionate
about mobile development, specially on Android. 
</p>
<p>In here there’s a senior full time developer who’s willing to
put all his knowledge to train future mobile developers (it may, or
may not be the admin). 
</p>
<ol>
	<li><p>The&nbsp;trainer or admin compromises to lecture a two hour
	session 3 times a week -- except when it’s not possible for
	superior reasons or there’s not an acceptable quorum of 60% of the
	people registered; everyone must always be advised of absences of
	any member (admin included). 
	</p>
	<li><p>This schedule may vary, in the interest of the group; 
	</p>
	<li><p>The date and time of the next lecture is scheduled at the end
	of the enduring session, by a poll; more than 60% declares the
	winner. 
	</p>
	<li><p>“You may buy a training course, but you’ll never buy the
	experience you take from it.” 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>mobWell Academy is not about money, but about the experience
		of growing together with other people from any part of the world
		that share the same passion for mobile apps. Knowledge is going to
		be shared with you: you’re expected to share your knowledge with
		the others. 
		</p>
		<li><p>In order to be eligible for this program you must fulfill
		the following requirements: 
		</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>pay the admin the same amount of money that Google requires
	to enroll their <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113468?hl=en">Android
	Development Program</a>&nbsp;(not in USD but in EUR - the exchange
	rate is for the administrative costs… the servers have to be
	paid)&nbsp;following the instruction handled to you in proper time; 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>compromise to write a chapter of the technical manual for
		other members to come. 
		</p>
		<li><p>This point is just to check if you’re still reading. 
		</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>Everything that’s made on the subject of this program
	belongs to the program (training material, and apps included). 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>If you disagree, remember you’re not obliged to it: Be
		honest and don’t enroll; 
		</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>In case you copy the material made specially for you without
	citing its sources, you’ll be disrespecting all your colleagues,
	the openness of the program, the free spirit of all the ones who
	promote the progress of mankind, &nbsp;and will incur on the heavy
	penalty of a guilty conscience, so leave never to come back: you
	won’t be missed. 
	</p>
	<li><p>“It’s worth more 20% of something than 100% of nothing.”.
		</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Every cent. of Euro made by mobWell Academy is equally
		distributed to their active members, that is, if your app is
		profitable, everyone is going to receive their share, like you’ll
		receive the share of the profits of the app of another group. 
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>If you disagree on point a), remember you’re not obliged
			to it: Be honest and don’t enroll; 
			</p>
			<li><p>If the Manual or training book makes any profit, it belongs
			to mobWell Academy, that is, the rule in a) is applied. 
			</p>
		</ol>
	</ol>
	<li><p>It’s not good to criticize negatively the work of a
	colleague member of the Academy (admin included). You are hereby
	obliged to talk to your colleague directly if you don’t like
	something that may be going on. Respect one another, like you’d
	like to be respected. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Every active member is responsible for the success of the
	project; 
	</p>
	<li><p>A member is considered to be inactive if: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>misses online meetings more than three times in a row; 
		</p>
		<li><p>misses more than 40% of the scheduled online meetings (after
		the tenth); 
		</p>
		<li><p>deliberately have not produced anything good for the project
		(one must achieve successfully at least 20% of the milestones of a
		project. 
		</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>To reactivate an inactive member there must be a poll, and
	it's needed more than 80% of positive answers from active members.</p>
	<li><p>Every member is carefully “handpicked” by any member of
	the Academy, but the inscription is reserved to the admin. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Material needed is going to be advised on time and in a
	proper place. Here follows a list of recommendations: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>Google Hangouts, for chatting in real time (chatting, not
		cheating); 
		</p>
		<li><p>OpenProject to manage the cooking timings;</p>
		<li><p>SchoolMaster as a hub for the session materials and needs; 
		</p>
		<li><p>Owncloud as an online drive of the needed material;</p>
		<li><p>Android Studio to make magic; 
		</p>
		<li><p>GitHub, to share the written code of the apps; 
		</p>
		<li><p>Any changes may occur, but every member shall be advised in
		that case. 
		</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p>All the sessions must use Webcam and micro. It’s mandatory.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><p>It’s reserved the right to session moderator to exclude
		from the session, if this condition is not met.</p>
	</ol>
	<li><p align="right">You've been warned: Everything may be learn and
	teach in mobWell Academy.</p>
</ol>
<p>May the force be with you, 
</p>
